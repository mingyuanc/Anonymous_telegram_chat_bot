# Anonymous_telegram_chat_bot
A telegram chat bot that matches random strangers together and provide a platform for them to engage in anonymous chat in the safety of telegram's platform.
This bot is mainly coded in python and uses the Pytelegrambot library with PostgreSQL database and hosted on heroku.
This bot matches two online strangers and allows them to send messages, stickers, videos and pictures to on another without ever exposing their identity unless they wish to. The chat is ended whenever anyone uses the /quit command. Users are also able to report other users that violates the rules.

This is my first ever solo project so do go easy on me :(

I included a dockerfile set up incase you wish to run locally
